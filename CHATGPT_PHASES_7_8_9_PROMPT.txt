I'm working on a design-to-code system with a backend that's production-ready. My friend will implement the frontend for Phases 7, 8, and 9 on a separate branch while I continue with Phase 11. I need you to give her clear instructions based on our current system so she can implement all three phases independently.

Here's the current system state: The backend has a complete API with these endpoints: POST /upload/ (user uploads PNG/JPG design, gets back Blueprint JSON with design tokens and components), POST /edit/enhance (takes command like "make button bigger" and blueprint, returns modified blueprint with reasoning), POST /generate/ (takes blueprint, returns React JSX files and Tailwind CSS), and GET /health (health check). The backend has Phase 10.2 multi-step execution with automatic rollback, deterministic output, and full JSON serialization. Phase 10.3.2a V2 is already deployed with intent result caching providing 2-6% performance improvement.

The frontend currently exists as a single-page app with: App.jsx (main entry, no routing), UploadPage.jsx (only page that exists), BuilderLayout.jsx (layout wrapper), CanvasArea.jsx (canvas rendering area), GeneratedWebsite.jsx (hard-coded landing page component), PreviewPanel.jsx (currently just JSON display), EditCommandInput.jsx (exists but not surfaced), and various other components. The project has React 18, Vite 6.4.1, and Tailwind CSS configured. There's no React Router, no dynamic blueprint rendering, no edit UI visible to users, no approval/rejection system, and no edit history tracking.

For Phase 7 (Multi-Page Routing), she needs to: Install React Router v6, create separate page components (StorefrontPage, AboutPage, LandingPage), update App.jsx to use BrowserRouter and Routes, add navigation links, and store multiple uploaded designs independently in state. Different image uploads should go to different pages with their own generated React code.

For Phase 8 (Live Blueprint Preview), she needs to: Create a BlueprintRenderer component that takes the blueprint JSON and renders it visually (not as JSON), apply design tokens to styling, handle all component types (button, navbar, product, text, container), create a BlueprintDiff component to show before/after visual comparisons, highlight what changed between edits, implement live updates so when a user enters an edit command and the blueprint is modified, the preview updates in real-time, and integrate this into the UI replacing the current JSON display.

For Phase 9 (User Iteration Loop), she needs to: Create a BlueprintEditor component showing the current blueprint (both raw JSON and visual rendering), create an EditHistory component that tracks all edits made with command text and reasoning, create a ChangeApproval component showing proposed changes before accepting or rejecting them, surface the EditCommandInput to the UI so users can type commands, implement undo/redo functionality that reverts to any previous blueprint state, show edit history with the ability to jump to any previous edit, and integrate an approval workflow where users see what changed before confirming.

The API contracts are: POST /upload returns {blueprint: {tokens: {primary_color, accent_color, base_spacing, border_radius, font_scale}, components: [{id, type, text, bbox, visual}]}, files: {App.jsx, tokens.js, etc}}. POST /edit/enhance returns {modified_blueprint, reasoning, success}. POST /generate returns {files: {App.jsx, tokens.js, component files}}. Component types include navbar, button, product, text, container.

For git workflow: She creates a branch called feature/phases-7-8-9, commits each phase separately with clear messages like "Phase 7: Add React Router...", "Phase 8: Dynamic rendering...", "Phase 9: Edit UI...", pushes to origin, and when done I will squash merge all three phases into main with a single commit for clean history and easy rollback. The squash merge command will be: git checkout main, git merge --squash feature/phases-7-8-9, git commit -m "Merge: Phases 7, 8, 9 - Frontend UI complete", git push origin main.

Files to create: StorefrontPage.jsx, AboutPage.jsx, LandingPage.jsx, BlueprintRenderer.jsx, BlueprintDiff.jsx, BlueprintEditor.jsx, EditHistory.jsx, ChangeApproval.jsx, BuilderWorkspace.jsx. Files to modify: App.jsx (add Router), UploadPage.jsx (state management), EditCommandInput.jsx (surface to UI), package.json (add React Router).

Success criteria for Phase 7: React Router installed and working, 4+ routes functional, navigation switches pages, multiple designs can be uploaded to different pages, each page shows its own code. For Phase 8: Blueprint renders visually not as JSON, colors and spacing from tokens applied, edit command updates preview live, diff viewer shows before/after, changed components highlighted. For Phase 9: Blueprint visible in editor panel, edit command input responsive, approval UI shows changes, accept/reject buttons work, edit history displays all changes, undo/redo functional, can revert to any previous state.

The backend is completely ready and should not be modified. All backend work is done. The frontend is 100% independent work that can happen in parallel. She should ask questions about backend API behavior, expected data formats, or UI preferences as needed. Please give her clear, step-by-step implementation instructions for all three phases with code examples, explain how the git branching and merge works, and help her understand the current system architecture so she can build on top of it properly.
